# Musical genre identikit

***"When the words fail, music speaks"**, Hans Christian Andersen*

# Abstract
Our goal is to draw an identikit-picture of the different music genres and subgenres. The [Million song](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) dataset provides several criteria like the duration, danceability, loudness, etc... We also want to analyze the most prolific types of music over the time and understand their evolution.

# Research questions
 - What define a musical genre?
 - What is the leading type of music over the time?
 - How evoled a musical genre?

# Dataset
We want to use the [Million song](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) dataset. This dataset provides several tags per song whose help us to classify the songs per musical type. The data are available on h5 files and a python [library](https://github.com/tbertinmahieux/MSongsDB/tree/master/PythonSrc) exists to manage them. The data set is pretty huge and we don't know how to work with a cluster so we are looking forward to hearing more about it. [Million song](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) provides some extra datasets whose could help us to enrich our analysis.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
 - Access to the database from the cluster.
 - Identificate the important metrics.
 - Differentiate genres and subgenres.

# Questions for TAs
-How works the cluster, and are there other detailed *Tutorials* than the one you already gave us?
-How to handle such a big database without getting a `Memory Error` with python?
